			While creating a hifi prototype of a weather application for astronomers, my team found that one of the most important aspects of catering to our stakeholder group was the inclusion of a night view. This view is specifically designed so as not to ruin an astronomers night vision. While most bright lights require astronomers to give their eyes time to adjust, red light does not have this effect.
			<br/><br/>
			Selecting the symbol at the top right corner of the application transforms the color scheme from purples, useful while indoors or during daylight hours, to a strictly black and red view.

			As part of a team of developers, I helped design a hifi prototype of a weather app for aspiring astronomers. We collaborated to create an application which emphasized the elements that astronomers place most importance on, as discovered through a variety of data gathering techniques.
			<br/><br/>
			In particular, these methods included interviews, surveys, and user testing. We reached out to local amateur astronomy groups, professors and students of astronomy, and astronomy groups on social media to ensure that our application catered to our specific stakeholder group.

			<br/><br/>
			While creating the hifi prototype for Atmosclear, a weather application for amateur astronomers, my team of developers undertook many methods of data gathering and user testing in order to refine the application. Prior to beginning implementation, we utilized photoshop to create images used in lofi prototyping and user testing. These studies led to many adjustments in the general design, and assisted in our color palette selection.
			<br/><br/>
			Additionally we gathered data on general trends by distributing surveys among societies dedicated to amateur astronomy and students studying astronomy. We interviewed two individuals, one professor of astronomy and one member of an astronomical society who frequently stargazes, in order to better understand our stakeholders.
			<br/><br/>
			Once implemented, we used the hifi prototype for further user testing, making smaller adjustments and increasing intuitive aspects of the application.

Utilizing a signature pink, symbolic of the fight against breast cancer, complemented by a deeper pink and simple yet effective neutrals, I helped Dr. Casteel achieve this goal.
			<br/><br/>

			<br/><br/>
			The Montessori Learning Center in San Diego is a school for children between 2-6 years of age, focusing on self-directed, non-competitive activities that help children develop strong self-images and confidence. As a member of staff, Diane Anderson was charged with maintaining MLC's presence online, and approached me looking to revamp their outdated site.
			<br/><br/>
			Throughout the design process, I strove to reflect the mission of Montessori schools. Moving away from traditional primary colors frequently utilized in websites revolving around preschool education and young children, but maintaining a bright color scheme, sets the site apart while still embracing MLC's target audience.
			<br/><br/>
			Accessibility was also a key component of the site, as it is a primary form of communication between parents and staff. It was therefore important to ensure that all pertinent information is easily accessible.
			<br/><br/>
			Finally, it was important that Ms. Anderson be able to maintain the website herself, as they release monthly updates on the site in the form of a newsletter. I gave Ms. Anderson personal training and written instructions in order to ensure that she would easily be able to achieve her desired tasks, and have since maintained an open line of communication in case she should have any questions.

			Due to the prominence of Maggie Phillips logo on her website, it was important that the logo reflect Ms. Phillips' personal style and brand - strong and bold, with a dark flare.
			<br/><br/>
			I wanted to immediately represent her role in the film community, utilizing old-style film strips to form Ms. Phillips' initials. Through the use of shadows these film strips took on a 3D effect, allowing them to pop from the backdrop.
			<br/><br/>
			I then embraced her desire for a dark site, utilizing a black backdrop, while creating a bold, architectural design in gold to add visual intrigue.

			While working with Dr. Casteel to create her website, I designed a logo for her so as to increase the cohesion of her online presence. While the emphasis of her presence is professionalism, I also wanted to introduce some interesting visual elements. I achieved this by creating a clean interplay between the letters of her logo, made legible through the use of color blocking. Additionally, the use of a pink ribbon, widely recognized as a symbol of the fight against breast cancer, allows individuals to easily recognize Dr. Casteel's field of work.
			<br/><br/>
			Dr. Casteel has since maintained a consistency in her branding by embroidering the finalized logo on her lab coats and printing it on business cards.

			Big Game Week 2015
			<br/><br/>
			Technology Utilized: Adobe Photoshop
			<br/><br/>
			On the UC Berkeley and Stanford University campuses, the week leading up to the rivalry football game is called Big Game Week. On both campuses, various events are held throughout the week to get the student body excited about the upcoming game.
			<br/><br/>
			The design concepts for each piece stemmed from iconic images of the UC Berkeley campus. The piece created for the Rally is a cross between our school mascot, a bear, and a torch. Fire is a traditional component in our Big Game Rallies, but in 2015 we were unable to have our usual large bonfire due to the California drought. As a result, I strove to emphasize the exitement inspired by bonfires of the past while looking towards the future and our new incorporation of cauldrons and fireworks.
			<br/><br/>
			The piece designed for the week of events is centered around the Campanile, the large clock tower on UC Berkeley's campus. Previous years' posters had made use of the same imagery, so I strove to create a new sensation by building a sense of industrialism. As the general theme of the week was creating a bridge between old and new traditions, particularly with the revamping of the Rally, which is the largest event of the week, it was fitting to create a sense of new construction.
			<br/><br/>
			As the Director of Publicity for the University of California Rally Committee, I was charged with creating these publicity materials. I led fellow students in putting up these posters around campus and handing out flyers to the student body, successfully bringing in large audiences for each of our events throughout the week.

			Homecoming Week 2015
			<br/><br/>
			Technology Utilized: Adobe Photoshop
			<br/><br/>
			A celebration of the campus community, Homecoming Week offers an opportunity for the community to visit UC Berkeley and attend various events. As the Director of Publicity for the University of California Rally Committee, I created posters (top image) and flyers (bottom images) advertising the events we were putting on throughout the week.
			<br/><br/>
			The design of the poster was inspired by nostalgia, evoking the style of an old fashioned movie theater marquee. As Homecoming is often a time for alumni to revisit their alma mater and parents to return to their college days by visiting their children, it is often a time to look towards the past.
			<br/><br/>
			The flyers were handed out to students as they were walking to and from campus, thus the main point of importance was visual interest. Many groups hand out flyers on Sproul Plaza, a main area of campus, and thus it is important to stand out. Consequently I worked to design elements that were both informative and aesthetically unique.

			During the first weeks of school UC Berkeley hosts a week meant for new students to explore social groups, clubs, and societies. As a part of that week, the UC Rally Committee puts on several different events, all of which we advertise through flyers and Facebook events.
			<br/><br/>
			As the Director of Publicity, I was charged with creating publicity materials for this endeavor. I utilized our mascot, the bear, for the top flyer design as the week is meant to bring together fellow bears. For the lower right flyer I used images from various activities the Committee undertakes to emphasize that which is unique about the Committee and encourage students to see the benefit of becoming a member.
			<br/><br/>
			We also put on a class during each semester on the spirit and traditions of UC Berkeley. We publicize the course using flyers as displayed on the lower left. As the course centers on Cal, I pulled images of iconic traditions from the University and incorporated them into a geometric design to add more interest and intricacy to the flyer.
